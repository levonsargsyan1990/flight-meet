Flight-Meet

Sample React application with use of FlightStat API and express.js for server

To run the app locally, following steps should be done

1) Create `.env` file in projects root directory and populate it with flightstat API creds as shown on `.env.axample`

2) Run `npm install` command to install dependancies

3) Run `npm start` command to run the app in production environment or `npm run dev` to run it in development environment
